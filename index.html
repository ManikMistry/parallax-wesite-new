        <h2>Cricket</h2>
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which
            is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
            The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat and then running between
            the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving
            the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of
            dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding
            side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket
            with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been
            dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a
            third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who
            record the match's statistical information.</p>

        <h2>Test</h2>
        <p>Test cricket is a form of first-class cricket played at international level between teams representing full
            member countries of the International Cricket Council (ICC). A match consists of four innings (two per team)
            and is scheduled to last for up to five days. In the past, some Test matches had no time limit and were
            called Timeless Tests. The term "test match" was originally coined in 1861â€“62 but in a different context.

        <h2>ODI</h2>
        <p>A One Day International (ODI) is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two teams with international
            status, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, currently 50, with the game lasting up to 9
            hours.[1][2] The Cricket World Cup, generally held every four years, is played in this format. One Day
            International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may
            also refer to Twenty20 International matches. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of
            List A, limited-overs competition.

            The international one day game is a late-twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5
            January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.[3] When the first three days of
            the third Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and, instead, play a one-off one day
            game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in
            white-coloured kits with a red-coloured ball.</p>

        <h2>T20</h2>
        <p>Twenty20 (T20) is a shortened game format of cricket. At the professional level, it was introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003 for the inter-county competition.[1] In a Twenty20 game, the two teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of 20 overs. Together with first-class and List A cricket, Twenty20 is one of the three current forms of cricket recognised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as being at the highest international or domestic level.

            A typical Twenty20 game is completed in about two and a half hours, with each innings lasting around 70 minutes and an official 10-minute break between the innings. This is much shorter than previous forms of the game, and is closer to the timespan of other popular team sports. It was introduced to create a fast-paced game that would be attractive to spectators at the ground and viewers on television.
